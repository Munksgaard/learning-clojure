Learning Clojure
================

This is where i will be documenting my experinces with Clojure, the
lisp-like language for the JVM.

Introduction
------------

### What is Clojure?

So, what is Clojure? From Wikipedia:

> Clojure is a modern dialect of the Lisp programming language. It is
> a general-purpose language supporting interactive development that
> encourages a functional programming style, and simplifies
> multithreaded programming.

Clojure is very new programming language (first made public in
2007). Therefore it is still in very active development, and many
exiting changes are happening all the time. This also means, that it
can be quite hard to keep up with all the changes. A new version may
break functionality in older versions, or have restructured the way
certain mechanics work.  
It is therefore a good idea to focus on one version of clojure and get
familiar with it before you move on to more recent versions.


### What is the purpose of this document?

This document is created primarily with the purpose of helping me
learn Clojure.  
The idea is, that the process of documenting all my
experiences with the language, i might be able to get a better
understanding of it. 
This means that sometimes i might not go into detail with specifics
which i didn't care about, or maybe my installation guide isn't
fulfilling for some or something else might be wrong, inacurate,
inspecific or just plain bad.  
The hope is, that someone else might find this guide useful, but it's
not the purpose or the goal.

### Target audience

Me.
I will assume that any readers of this document have basic
understanding of programming concepts, has programmed before in some
other language, possibly a Lisp but not necessarily and has some
computer savvy. 

### Tools, technical prerequisites etc.

I will assume that the reader uses some form of Linux. I myself will
primarily be using Gentoo linux, but i will go through all the basic
steps of installation and setup on a virtual machine with Ubuntu 10.10
on it. 
I will be using Clojure 1.2.0 as that is the stable release at the
time of writing. I will be using cake for project management (more on
that later) and emacs (22 or 23) for my development environment. I
will assume that you are familiar with emacs, but i will probably be
describing some basic tips and tricks for working with Clojure.
